This makes all <canvas> elements fill 90% of the width of whatever they're inside.
We deliberately do not set the height here too - when we set canvas.width
and canvas.height in Map.js, this 90% helps keep the canvas from being too big,
but not setting the height means the image keeps the correct aspect ratio (it'll be set
automatically to the correct thing).
