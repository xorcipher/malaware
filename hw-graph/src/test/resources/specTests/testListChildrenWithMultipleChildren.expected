# Tests that the getChildren method works properly for a graph in which the graph contains the specified node, and the node has multiple children.

# Return all the children of a given node within a given graph in a List.

created graph graph

added node A to graph
added node B to graph
added node C to graph

added edge edgeA from A to B in graph
added edge edgeB from A to C in graph

the children of A in graph are: B(edgeA) C(edgeB)
