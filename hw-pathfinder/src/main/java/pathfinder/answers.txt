Describe any changes you made to your marvel or graph code, other
than making changes to support generics:

I made a couple changes: my testing code had to be altered to be more more robust,
and my MarvelPaths was altered a little for testing consistency. Other than that,
I only changed documentation, and removed the equals method for my Graph since it was
useless. But that didn't affect anything.

I also updated all my spec tests because I was doing them wrong.
