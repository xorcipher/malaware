# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the nodes entered have two paths between them
# with the same cost. This should result
# in a path with the least number of hops.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph

added edge 5.000 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 2.500 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 2.500 from B to C in simpleGraph

path from A to C:
A to C with weight 5.000
total cost: 5.000
